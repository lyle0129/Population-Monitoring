## üìå Introduction  
This project focuses on **real-time monitoring of in-building population** to support **emergency evacuation efforts**. By integrating multiple sensors with an STM32 microcontroller and cloud-based services, the system aims to detect human activity, track inflow/outflow dynamics, and issue alerts during potential disaster scenarios.  

The system addresses key objectives:  
- Monitoring inflow and outflow of people  
- Mitigating risks and aiding rescue efforts during emergencies  
- Detecting disasters and ensuring seamless communication
